The [[Algovera]] Storage Pod is an effort to make the user experience for decentralized data storage easy to use, efficient, and modular.

## First Prototype
Our first prototype will be to develop a [[Jupyter Notebook MetaMask Integration]] so users can store their [[IPFS]] keys safely without having to export them. Alongside this, we plan to add [[IPFS]] as a StorageProvider for [[Activeloop/Hub]].

The data scientist flow for our first prototype will be:
1. Spin up a jupyter notebook.
2. Connect using the [[Jupyter Notebook MetaMask Integration]].
3. Use [[Activeloop/Hub]] to load and begin streaming a dataset stored in [[IPFS]] to train a model.
