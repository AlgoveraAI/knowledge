[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (Interplanetary Filesystem) is a distributed file system developed for the web3 cause. There is also something called [[Filecoin]] that was built on top of IPFS to incentivize data storage using crypto currency.

There is an open source project called [ipfspec](https://pypi.org/project/ipfsspec/) that is building an [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation for IPFS. [[HuggingFace/Datasets]] uses the fsspec interface for their library, and [[Activeloop/Hub]] uses a similar interface.
